					<p>Introduction</p>

				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/projectLogo.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Analyzing the release patterns and content characteristics of Netflix shows provides valuable
					insights into the evolution of streaming services and consumer preferences. For this study, we will
					utilize a dataset encompassing Netflix shows released between 2008 and 2021. This dataset not only
					highlights the company's strategic shifts but also sheds light on the variety of content offered to
					viewers over the years. It includes detailed information about each movie and series, such as the
					names of actors and directors, release dates, and categorical variables like content rating and type
					(TV Show or Movie). With over 7000 entries, the dataset reveals significant trends and gaps, such as
					missing director and cast member names, which have been addressed by imputing with "unknown" or
					removing overly detailed descriptions. By visualizing this data, we aim to uncover patterns in
					release volumes and other key metrics, enhancing our understanding of Netflix's content strategy and
					its impact on the video-on-demand landscape.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis1.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Visualising data can give us a much better understanding of the data and what it represents, in this
					first diagram the main focus will be to show the number of shows released to the streaming service.
					The company began running cloud streaming services in 2008 and we can observe that in its initial
					start, the service was not so popular, due to the fact that in early 2000, the company started as a
					DVD distributor. Something to note is the missing instances in 2010, the reason for that might be
					that during the cleaning of the data, some of it might have been removed due to junk data, or due to
					entirely missing information in the date section of the data. The null values are movies or series
					that were released but there was no information regarding their release date, those instances of
					movies were kept because they still offer information that can be used. We can also observe a trend
					with the increase in popularity of cloud streaming services, we can note that on-demand for
					streaming services became more popular in the most recent years.
					In the following graph, we will be looking into the popularity of stand-up comedy throughout the
					years.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis2.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>By filtering the Ganres to show only the stand-up comedy genres, we can see that the demand for the
					genre increases and the amount of added shows gradually rises until it peaks in 2018, after that, we
					can see a downward trend with the amount of added shows.In our data the movie genres vary from one
					another, for example, the genre of one movie could be Action & Adventure and there are movies that
					are “ Action & Adventure, Anime Features, Children & Family Movies” There are further 5 more
					sub-categories for the Action & Adventure genre, due to this we will be grouping the all the
					different sub-categories in order to better understand the witch genres were more popular throughout
					the years, the same concept will be applied for the other genres to make visualisation more
					efficient.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis3.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>After the data is sorted in ascending order, an observation can be made as to how the demand for
					different genres increases throughout the year. We can note that there is an upward trend after 2014
					in regard to the “Drama”, “Comedies”, and “Documentaries” releases, they gradually until the numbers
					peak during 2019. After 2019 the top most popular genres either remain constant as is the case for
					the comedy genre, or they begin to gradually decrease. </p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis4.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>From this simple graph, we can make a consideration that the organisation is trying to appeal the
					mature audience. Further using the information from this table we can group all the ratings for the
					mature audience and observe what are the most popular titles among the mature audience. For that, a
					set will be created with the corresponding rating.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis5.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p> From this view, it can be noted that the demand for the mature audience is more focused on “Drama
					titles” (802 title releases), “Comedies”(557 title releases) and “Documentaries”(400 title
					releases). Further looking into the set for the “General audience” </p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis6.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>There are some similarities, we can note that both the “mature audience” and the “general audience”
					have the “Drama” genre as one of the top 3.
					Moreover by making an inner joining both for both “mature audience” and “general audience” and using
					it as a filter, in the end, the result of the data displayed will be only the instances that occur
					in both sets. This will be especially useful as the organisation can provide content in that area
					and satisfy more of its customer base.
				</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis7.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>An interesting finding is that in 2018 the most popular genres for the general audience are Drama,
					Documentaries and Children & Family Movies.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis8.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>But in 2019 there is a big shift in the genres.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis9.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>The most notable one is that during this year the most amount of content added is “Children & Family
					Movies” and the content added for “Drama” has decreased from what it was during 2018. Another very
					notable change is that the content of “Action & Adventure” and “Comedy” genres have significantly
					increased.</p>
				<p><b>Selection of Data Mining Algorithm and Data Pre-processing:</b></p>
				<p>For the chosen data mining algorithm that will be implemented is the time series algorithm. Time
					series is collecting numerical data in sequential time intervals. The time intervals can be (yearly,
					quarterly, monthly, weekly and more depending on the data used). A time-series plot shows the
					variable of interest against the interval of time. In our case our dataset for the release date of
					titles we have information up to the date where an instance of a title was added, our variable of
					interest, in this case, will be the number of titles released and the interval of time will be the
					release dates of titles</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis10.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>In this graph that was used for the data visualisation, we can observe that there is a trend in the
					popularity of stand-up comedy shows, based on this data we can start making predictions on future
					trends, this can also be applied for different genres.The main variables that will be used for the
					data mining section will be the count of titles released and the release dates. The first major
					alteration to the dataset was that the release date section was formatted to DD/MM/YY, there were
					some instances where data in regards to the release date was missing, so it was decided to delete
					those instances of data as we cannot use them, further, there were instances where the date was not
					showing in the right format, that data was also removed from the dataset. Each table row was
					transformed to the right format type e.g.(in the type row in our data it is set to be either TV-Show
					or Movie).</p>
				<p><b>Data Mining</b></p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis11.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>In this first graph a linear trendline is used, and we can make a note that the strength of the fit
					of this model is considerably above average for the first two genres Comedies with an r-value of
					(0.66), Children & Family with an r-value of (0.67) and strength of the fit is not as good for the
					Action & Adventure genre with(0.45). The strength of the model fifths the Children & Family model
					best which suggests that the number of instances added in a year will gradually increase throughout
					the years, which may suggest that it will come close to the numbers of the Comedies.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis12.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>In this next graph the first observation made is that the strength of the model fits very well the
					r-value in this case for the forecast is 0.81 and for the actual forecast indicator it is 0.77, the
					trendline suggests that there is some upwards trend.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis13.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>For this time series a Polinominal trendline is used, there is a strong fit with the model the
					r-value for the Actual Movies added is (0.86) and the r-value for the estimation is 0.99. In this
					diagram, there is a downward trend in the actual model and we can see that estimation confirms that
					trend.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis14.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>This time series shows the trend of TV shows in comparison to Movies and their corresponding trends.
					The trend of the Actual movies is upwards, the strength of the fit is 0.72, and the r-value for the
					estimated Movies is 0.99 which fits the model well, there is an upwards trend that can be observed
					also. The model fits the actual and estimated TV show quite well with an r-value of 0.86 for the
					actual and 0.99 for the estimated forecast.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="./images/Analysis15.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>In this time series, there are two genres that are less popular amongst the general audience. In this
					case, the model seems to not fit solid the Children and family genre, the r-values here are 0.56 for
					the actual genre and for the estimated one it is 0.39. Moving to the other genre, the strength of
					the fit is higher than what it was in the other genre and its forecast, the r-values for the actual
					British TV series is 0.85 and the estimate is 0.78, in this time series we can observe an upwards
					trend for the Children& Family genre, the trend for the British TVseries, on the other hand, is
					remains constant and we are not observing much of a trend.</p>
				<p><b>Data Ethics:</b></p>
				<p>Regarding data ethics relating to data analysis, the main concern here is Privacy, it has to be
					considered that one has the right to:Confidentiality - meaning that one can limit the spread of
					information about themselves.Anonymity- stating that anyone has the right to be free from unwanted
					attentionSolitude- avoidance of physical proximity to others.The concerns regarding the ethical
					issue are the private information of individuals, and how it can affect them, in general, data
					mining is capable of identifying individuals from a large amount of anonymous data. In order to
					protect private data there have to be security measures implemented, but the responsibility falls
					under the organisation, government, and businesses in other words the responsibility falls under the
					organisation that is collecting that information. In order to regulate data collection in order to
					prevent security violations the GDPR was invented, its main purpose is to clear the concerns of
					customers, regulators and other groups regarding the safety of personnel data. Another purpose of
					the GDPR is to account for the swift development of modern data processing techniques and
					technologies.Looking at the professional issue is that computer professionals must design their
					systems in a way that the user is aware of what information is being stored about them and another
					requirement for a system is that it should allow an individual to customise the levels of privacy
					like the level of security and the level of acceptable recording/monitoring/tracking. Professionals
					have a duty to implement adequate security measures, meaning the data has to be preserved in a way
					that third parties will not interfere, an example of this will be preserving the data through either
					encryption or anonymisation.</p>
				<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
				<p>To conclude from the trends observed we can note on that the exponential growth in the titles
					released for the “General audience” as well as for the “Adult audience”. Further from the overall
					analysis, it seems that there is a larger volume of content that is added for the “General
					audience”. Another observation is that there seems to be a larger volume of Movies compared to the
					TV-Serieses and from the findings above we can note the fact that this trend will continue
					throughout the year when the ratio of movies to series is higher.
					The strength of which the model fitted the data is considerably strong, the lowest value for the
					strength of the model that we have is (0.45) and the highest (0.99) .
					Managers from Netflix can use these findings to find witch genres are gaining popularity and it
					could greatly help in their decision-making, regarding what type of content they should be adding.
					They could also use this to make further predictions on what the audience would like to see more in
					the future.
					Furthermore, if you are a content provider and you want this can greatly helps as they can use these
					findings to see what kind of content is being added and what kind of content they should focus on to
					offer to the streaming service. Another example where this information can help is in the
					movie/tv-series industry as it provides a glimpse to what is the current demand for the user, as
					well as how it might be in the future. This could help directors to focus on genres that are popular
					among the audience, or to focus on genres that are predicted to gain more popularity.
